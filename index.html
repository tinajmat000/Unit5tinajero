        <h1>Text Formatting</h1>
        <p>There are three main types of text formatting. Those are <b>bold</b>, <i>italics</i>, and <u>underline</u>.</p>

        <h2>Inline vs. Block Elements</h2>
        <p>A <b>block element</b> moves the content to a new line. the paragraph and header elements. An <b>inline element</b> does not display its content on a new line it keeps the</p>

        <h3><u>Block Elements Examples</u></h3>
        <p>this is a paragraph.<p></p>

        <p>an<b>image element</b> in an <i>inline</i> element which inserts pictures into the document. An image element is self-closing,which means
        it does not have a closing tag. It has one major attribute, src, which is a filepath that points to the images' location. Those filepaths can
        either be <b>Absolute</b> <b>Relative</b></p>

        <h2>Image attributes</h2>
        <p>There are 4 attributes commonly used for images. <i>width</i>and <i>height</i>are used to resize the images. <i>alt</i> allows to use the text description of images for accesibility
        and broken images, <i>title</i>allows a hover-over text to appear</p>

        <h3>Width and Height</h3>
        <p>The width and height can be measured in many different ways, but more common ones are pixels and percentages.</p>

        <img src="https://wallup.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/10/343179-landscape-nature.jpg" titl="Set width and height using pixels and respecting aspect ratio" width="150px" height="150px">

             <h3>Alt Attribute</h3>
        <p>Every picture should at LEAST have the alt attribute. The alt attribute helps with screen readers for visually impaired and in case the image is broken</p>

        <img src="https://wallup.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/10/343179-landscape-nature.jpg" width="50%">
        <img src="https://wallup.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/10/343179-landscape-nature.jpg" alt="river running through taiga and mountains" width="50%"
        <img src="https://wallup.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/10/343179-landscape-nature.jpg" title="river running through taiga and mountains" width="50%"

             <h2>Relative vs. absolute</h2>
        <p>an <b>absolute</b> filepath includes all the navigation to get to the server, folder and file. The examples above are all absolute filepaths. An absolute filepath is used
        when the image is stored on a different server or device than the HTML document</p>

        <p>A <b>relative</b> filepath only includes folders and files. The example below is relative filepath. A relative filepath is used when the images are stored alongside the HTML document</p>

        <img src="tree.jpg" width="150px" alt="tree posted in a meadow">

        <h1 style="color: #f05454">Links</h1>
        <p>The <b>anchor element</b> is an <i>inline element</i> and is a way to include hypertext, otherwise known as just links, in your document.
             An anchor is a reference point for other documents or files. It commonly has 3 attributes: <i>href</i>, <i>target</i> and <i>download</i></p>

        <h2>A simple link</h2>
        <a href="http://ihasabucket.com/">Link</a>

        <p>In order for the link to work it <b>MUST</b> include the <i>href</i> attribute. This attribute is the filepath, either absolute or relative
         to the document, website or file you wish to link</p>

        <h2>Link Attributes</h2>
        <p>The <i>target</i>attribute allows you to decide where the link opens.</p>

        <a href="http://ihasabucket.com/" target="_blank">This link will open in a new tab</a>

        <p>The <i>download</i> attribute allows you to download the file or document linked and assign it a new filename. This is commonly
        used with relative filepaths</p>

        <a href="tree.jpg" download="treePic">This will download a Tree picture</a>

        <h2>A picture as Link</h2>
        <p>Since a link has an opening AND a closing tag, we can place ANY HTML ELEMENT as its content, which includes pictures. We simply
        nest the img inside the anchor element</p>

        <a href="ihasabucket" target="_blank">
            <img src="tree.jpg" width="150px" alt="sillhouette of a deer in a meadow at sunset">
        </a>

        <h2>Link to Another Page</h2>
